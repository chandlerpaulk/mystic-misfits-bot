# Steps to creating Discord Bot

## Install / Run ngrok
1. Open your command prompt as admin and run the command 'ngrok http <YOUR_PORT>'

2. Copy the 'https' link that is generated and go to your discord app dashboard

3. If you haven't already, make sure to go to the 'bot' section and paste the link generated by ngrok into the 'interactions endpoint URL'

4. Be sure to leave the command prompt you are running ngrok on open while running your app

## Setting up your Discord App
1. Once inside your Discord App, navigate to the OAuth2 tab on the dashboard and then the 'URL Generator'

2. Once inside, you'll see a large list of options; for now click the 'bot' and 'applications.commands' and then paste the generated url it creates into a new tab

3. In the new tab, follow the prompts and select the server you'd like to invite your new bot to

## Installing with node.js
1. Once all the previous steps are completed, you're ready to start running your new bot.

2. First type 'npm install' into the CLI of the project folder you are working in

3. Then run 'node command.js' to install all the commands into the interface of your bot

4. Now run 'node app.js' to make your bot go live.

5. Go test out your new bot in Discord!
